# Amazon-Sales-Data-EDA-Project
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Amazon sales data to uncover key insights and trends regarding customer preferences and order fulfillment. The analysis involves data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation of various metrics that provide a comprehensive view of the sales landscape.

## Objectives

**Data Cleaning:** Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, renaming columns, and ensuring correct data types.

**Exploratory Analysis:** Visualize the data to identify trends, customer behaviors, and sales patterns across different categories and sizes.


## Data Cleaning Tasks

Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for analysis. This process involved identifying and addressing issues such as irrelevant or missing data, ensuring that the dataset is complete and ready for meaningful insights. The following tasks were performed to enhance data quality:

1. Dropped irrelevant or blank columns.

2. Checked for null values and calculated the total count of nulls.

3. Deleted rows with null values to ensure data integrity.

4. Changed data types for appropriate analysis.

5. Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.

6. Formatted float values for uniformity.

7. Generated descriptive statistics for specific columns to summarize data.


## Exploratory Analysis

### 1. Size Distribution:

A count plot was generated to analyze the distribution of product sizes purchased by customers. The analysis revealed that the M-size category was the most popular among buyers, indicating a strong preference for medium-sized products. This insight could inform inventory decisions and marketing strategies targeting size preferences.

### 2.Courier Status:

By examining the courier status of the orders, it was found that a significant majority of the orders are shipped via couriers. This finding highlights the efficiency of courier services in fulfilling customer orders and may suggest that improving relationships with courier partners could further enhance customer satisfaction and delivery times.
